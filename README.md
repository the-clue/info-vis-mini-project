#### Mosquitoes Visualization
This project visualizes the movement of mosquitoes using D3.js. The mosquitoes move to different positions on click, and users can click on individual mosquitoes to "squash" them, which will turn them red and make them unable to move.

### Features
- Dynamic mosquito movement on click
- Squash mosquitoes by clicking on them
- Tooltip to show mosquito coordinates

### File Structure
- index.html: The main HTML file.
- styles/style.css: The CSS file for styling.
- scripts/script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic.
- data: The folder containing the JSON files with mosquito coordinates.
- images/mosquito.svg: The SVG file for the mosquito silhouette.
